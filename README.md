# ExampleLEWIE_Code
Example code for LEWIE model

This is based on the Aquaculture LEWIE developped for Myanmar. 
The model was used for the World Development paper Filipski and Belton which can be found here:

The file to run in GAMS is the one called "AQ_LEWIE_maincode.gms".  All other files are called from that one. 

The most important include file is "includes/3_Model.gms".  It has the actual model statement.  The rest is all calibration/running/reporting.
